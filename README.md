## 🤔 Why Remake?

> "Remake gives me an entirely new feeling of comfort around coding. It's what I imagine web development should be." — [Arav Narula](https://twitter.com/HeyArav)

Remake does what most frameworks do in 100 lines of code in 1 line of HTML.

```html
<h1 object key:text="@innerText" edit:text>{{text}}</h1>
```

## 👩‍🎨 Let people use something you designed — *right away.*

### Remake is

<details>
  <summary><b>🏭 Full-stack apps with just front-end code</b></summary>
  
  Remake takes care of the rest: user accounts, persistent data, instant deployments, and routing. Each user gets their own account and data.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>🛩 Real apps — not just prototypes</b></summary>
  
  Remake feels like prototyping because it was designed to. The goal was to make web development feel like using a single template and a single JSON file.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>🎨 100% control of your design</b></summary>
  
  Remake is open source. You own the code. There's no platform lock-in and you have 100% control over your app's design.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>🌍 Secure, scalable, and fast</b></summary>
  
  Highly secure authentication. And server-rendered, so your pages load quickly even on low-power devices and slow connections.
</details>

## 👩‍🏫 Get started

### 1. Install [Node.js (12.16+)](https://nodejs.org/)

### 2. Create a project using the Remake CLI

```sh
npx remake create my-app
```

### 3. Run the project

```sh
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

You now have an app running at `http://localhost:3000`. Your app's code is in the `/app` directory and your database is in the `/app/data` directory.

## 🚀 Remake’s Mission

⚖️ Remake's goal is to equalize power on the internet.

A few companies own the platforms the rest of us publish on — but owning our own platform is usually out of the question. Remake lets you build your own platform with very little effort — using just HTML & CSS.
